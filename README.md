# amfoss-tasks

## SELF INTRO
I am Karthik Kishor, a first-year student in BTECH CSE. My interests are to learn different programming languages, improve my problem solving skills and participate in hackathons.
## INTROSPECTION
### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
I began to learn coding from my 11th and from then on learning new functions and modules in python have always grown my interests in coding. I believe amFOSS will guide me through my journey and let me acquire greater knowledge. I do have a feeling that I have what it takes to be a member of the amFOSS and I also believe that taking me in would benefit the club as well.
### WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS? HOW WILL YOU ACCOMPLISH THEM?
I plan to improve my coding skills. Seeing the various tasks and reading the resources made me understand there are whole lot of things I don't know about. So I plan to learn, understand and apply them in projects that is beneficial to the society. I beleive that the mentor-mentee relationship that provides will help me achieve my goal. I also aim to have a CGPA of 8 or above in my end-sem exams.
### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I would be happy to work with other club members, help in solving problems and contribute to the projects as well.
### DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
On my first reading, I found the tasks hard. But I do feel that these tasks are structured in such a way so as to choose only the ones who have courage, determination and time to contribute and take up the challenge even if you feel you can't do it.
