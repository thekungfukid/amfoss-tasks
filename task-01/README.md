# Terminal Wizard

The task was easy and I was able to complete the challenges - Maths & Harry Potter :smile: - with the help of google. 
While working on this task I learned and used the following 
  - linux commands - cd, ls,touch, mkdir, cp, mv, rm, gedit
  - git commands - clone, add, status, commit, push
  
I was able to google and solve the issues faced while running the linux and git commands.
